          Ever thought about getting published in the next <i>The Newyorker</i>
          issue? <br />
          Well I have! If you too, well we can easily agree that the road, if it
          exists is rather long but guess what?
          <br /> What?
          <br /> Wouldn't it be nice to share some piece of fiction or
          non-fiction in a very easy and pleasant way?
          <br />
